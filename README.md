# Aortic-SR
An intelligent system for aortic segmentation and reconstruction (aortic-SR) based on NCCT was developed and compared with CT angiography (CTA)-based aortic reconstruction results.
Aorta_net: the benchmark model.
nnUNet: Based on Aortic-SR developed by nnUNet-v2 and Aortic-SNet(i.e. nnUNet/nnunetv2/training/nnUNetTrainer/AortaNet/AortaV1)
